First day. Went well!

I made a little change here!

> I wrote code. 

I cried.

`I wrote more code.`

There were mistakes. 
## But we pulled through!
I have thoughts.
* This one
* And this one.
* Aaaand this one.

Overall, I liked it. Time for a [burrito bowl](http://chipotle.com). 

## I'm so excited for this!
###This is a less important thought. 

Ok I made a mistake so I added this change.
